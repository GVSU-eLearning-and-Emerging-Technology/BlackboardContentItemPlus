# BlackboardContentItemPlus

A Javascript that can be included inside Blackboard that enables improved UX, including action tags for content items and "header" items.

## How to use this

1. Choose a content area where you'd like to use these features.
2. Create an item in that content area. Give it a name like "Script". The name doesn't matter too much; this content item will be made invisible when edit mode is off.
3. Use the HTML mode editor to set the item's content to the following code snippet. Please note that when this tool is out of testing, a different URL will be used.

~~~html
